Hi my name is Stevie DuPree. I am a senior here at COFC and I am a CITA major. 
I was born and raised here in Charleston. My plan currently is to land a job at Sales Force while I finish out my semester. 
Once I've got the experience possibly work somewhere else I'm not entirely sure what I want to do after that. 
I would like to travel some and possibly work somewhere else other than Charleston for a little.
